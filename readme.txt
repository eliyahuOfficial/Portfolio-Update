_________Eliyahu Levi Portfolio______________

I'm excited to share my latest project—an elegant portfolio page that reflects my journey in web development. 

The design is clean, featuring a top toolbar, a main section introducing myself, and a project gallery showcasing seven creations crafted with HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

Towards the end of the page, you'll find a contact section with my information, making it easy for you to get in touch. 

I value open communication and collaboration, and this section underscores that commitment.

I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning a bit about me. 

Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to connecting.

Best
